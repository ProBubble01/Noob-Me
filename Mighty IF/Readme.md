⚠️Use at your own risk⚠️
 
Running this script will create another python program that checks if a given number is odd or even
But instead of looping, it writes code for Upto 100000000.
That will generate a file of size ~10GiB and cause severe lag

This was me just goofing around with read and write operations.

⚠️please don't use it lol⚠️
